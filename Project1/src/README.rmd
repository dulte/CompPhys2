### Running the Simulation
The program is compiled through QT, by opening the pro file in the QT editor and compiling. Before compiling one has to choose what to simulate. In **main** one will find the different types of simulate: Simulation of alphas in a given interval, simulation of a single alpha, finding of the optimal alpha using gradient descent, and the calculation of the onebody density. The instruction of which lines to comment/uncomment to run which type of simulation if found in **main**.

To run the program, one can either run it from the QT editor, or through the terminal. When using the editor the program will run on 1 processor. By using the terminal, one can choose to run the program with more processes by

```
mpirun -np x VMC
```
where *x* is the number of processes used.
