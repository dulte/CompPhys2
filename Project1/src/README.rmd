### Running the Simulation
The program is compiled through QT, by opening the pro file in the QT editor and compiling. Before compiling one has to choose what to simulate. In **main** one will find the different types of simulate: Simulation of alphas in a given interval, simulation of a single alpha, finding of the optimal alpha using gradient descent, and the calculation of the onebody density. The instruction of which lines to comment/uncomment to run which type of simulation if found in **main**.

To run the program, one can either run it from the QT editor, or through the terminal. When using the editor the program will run on 1 processor. By using the terminal, one can choose to run the program with more processes by

```
mpirun -np x VMC
```
where *x* is the number of processes used.

### Analysis
There are three different analysis programs: 

The first will plot the results of the gradient descent. After doing the simulation, one should only need to run
```
python3 gradien_plot.py
```

The second program plots the onebody density. By default this will only plot the most rescent onebody density made by the simulation. To be able compare the onebody densities with and without interaction, one needs to hardcode a different name for the file containing density in **simulation.cpp** to *density_non.bin*. One should then uncomment the commented lines in **flott_plots.py**. There is no problem running the program without these changes. This will only plot the onebody density for either the interacting or noninteracting onebody density, depending on parameters used when doing the simulation. To make the plot, only run 
```
python3 flott_plots.py
```

The last program calculate the local energy and error for given alphas. There are three different ways of running this program. The first is used when the simulation is run over an interval of alphas. The second is used then the simulation is used for one single alpha. The last is done to find the variance for different step length. There is no easy way of using this, and was mostly used by us to make a fast stability check -- so ignore this --. To change the way of using the progam, (un)comment the different lines instructed in the last lines in ***data_analytics.py**.To make the plot, only run 
```
python3 data_analytics.py
```
