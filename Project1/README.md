# Project 1

Solving a system of bosons in a Harmonic Oscillator Potential, with and without interaction.

## Content

### 1: [Benchmarks](https://github.com/dulte/FYS4411/tree/master/Project1/Benchmarks)
This folder contains our results from benchmarking our code against known analytic results.

### 2: [Report](https://github.com/dulte/FYS4411/tree/master/Project1/Report)
This folder contains our report, including the LaTeX file and the .bib file.

### 3: [Results](https://github.com/dulte/FYS4411/tree/master/Project1/Results)
This folder contains all the plots used in the final report.

### 4: [Src](https://github.com/dulte/FYS4411/tree/master/Project1/src)
This folder contains the source code for the solver. All the choices for the different systems are made in the parameters file. Data about the local energies are dumped in an output folder (in case this folder does not exist, make it and everything should work). This folder also contains the Python scripts for analyzing the data.
