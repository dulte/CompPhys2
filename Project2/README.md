# Project 2

Solving a system of 1 and 2 fermions in a Harmonic Oscillator Potential using a restricted Boltzmann machine. This is done with 
both Monte Carlo simulations (brute force and with importance sampling) and with Gibbs sampling.

## Content

### 1: [Report](https://github.com/dulte/FYS4411/tree/master/Project2/Report)
This folder contains our report, including the LaTeX file and the .bib file.

### 2: [Results](https://github.com/dulte/FYS4411/tree/master/Project2/Results)
This folder contains all the plots used in the final report.

### 3: [Src](https://github.com/dulte/FYS4411/tree/master/Project2/src)
This folder contains the source code for the solver. All the choices for the different systems are made in the parameters file. Data about the local energies are dumped in an output folder (in case this folder does not exist, make it and everything should work). This folder also contains the Python scripts for analyzing the data.
