@article{Broecker2017,
abstract = {State-of-the-art machine learning techniques promise to become a powerful tool in statistical mechanics via their capacity to distinguish different phases of matter in an automated way. Here we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be optimized for quantum many-fermion systems such that they correctly identify and locate quantum phase transitions in such systems. Using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to sample the many-fermion system, we show that the Green's function holds sufficient information to allow for the distinction of different fermionic phases via a CNN. We demonstrate that this QMC + machine learning approach works even for systems exhibiting a severe fermion sign problem where conventional approaches to extract information from the Green's function, e.g. in the form of equal-time correlation functions, fail.},

@article{Carleo602,
abstract = {Elucidating the behavior of quantum interacting systems of many particles remains one of the biggest challenges in physics. Traditional numerical methods often work well, but some of the most interesting problems leave them stumped. Carleo and Troyer harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem (see the Perspective by Hush). The method performed at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches, setting a benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. With further development, it may well prove a valuable piece in the quantum toolbox.Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 580The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing prototypical interacting spins models in one and two dimensions.},

abstract = {Particular analytical solutions of the two-dimensional Schrodinger equation are described for two electrons (interacting with Coulomb potentials) in a homogeneous magnetic field B and an external oscillator potential with frequency omega 0 . These exact solutions occur at an infinite and countable set of values of the quantity omega = square root ( omega 0 2 + 1/4 (B/c) 2 ). Additionally, approximate closed-form solutions for the limits of small omega (perturbation theory in the electron-electron interaction) and large omega (harmonic approximation) are discussed and compared with the exact solutions.},
